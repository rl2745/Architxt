- to compile, run $make and this should give you toplevel.native
	* note that the ast.ml pretty printing prints "OKAY" at the end of an accepted file for testing purposes
- to execute the program, run $./toplevel.native ____.arc where ____ is an .arc file
- to test, run $./testall.sh
	all of the tests should return #: POSITIVE/NEGATIVE TEST WORKED with # as the test number

We still need to add in more point and map features.
